# Project Overview

## Disaster Risk Management in the U.S. South

### Background

Southern U.S. states face disproportionate impacts from natural disasters:
- Florida: 120+ hurricanes since 1851, 800+ tornadoes from 1949-2016
- Mississippi: Nearly 50% of federal disaster declarations since 1980 were severe storms
- Region experiences hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and severe weather events

### Inclusive Growth Focus

Integration of Mastercard Inclusive Growth Score (IGS):
- Economic health and inclusion metric (0-100 scale)
- Based on 18 socioeconomic indicators
- Census tract level granularity
- Identifies vulnerable communities where disasters impact inclusive growth

### Technical Approach

#### Data Integration
- NOAA Storm Events Database (1950-2025)
- FEMA Disaster Declarations
- CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)
- Mastercard Inclusive Growth Score (IGS)
- Billion-Dollar Disasters Dataset

#### Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data processing and feature engineering
2. Predictive risk modeling (regression)
3. Risk classification (high/medium/low)
4. Model validation and refinement

#### Visualization
- Interactive county-level risk maps
- Time series analysis
- Correlation visualizations
- Disaster and county profiles

### Expected Outcomes

- Identification of high-risk vulnerable communities
- Predictive model for disaster impact assessment
- Interactive tool for decision-makers
- Data-driven insights for resilience planning

### Key Metrics

- Expected annual loss by county
- Risk classification scores
- Vulnerability indices
- Historical event frequency and severity

### Timeline

- Phase 1: Data acquisition (Weeks 1-2)
- Phase 2: Exploratory analysis (Weeks 2-3)
- Phase 3: Model development (Weeks 3-5)
- Phase 4: Dashboard development (Weeks 4-6)
- Phase 5: Testing and deployment (Week 6+)
